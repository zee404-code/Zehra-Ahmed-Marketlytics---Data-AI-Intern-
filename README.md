I discuss my Project experience working at an AI-based startup, where our goal was to automate the HR recruitment process. I share the challenges I faced and the research-intensive trial and error progress I made. I explain how we used AI algorithms to analyze applicants' digital footprints and personality types to categorize and filter the applicant pool. I also discuss the importance of creating personas and using time series analysis to predict an applicant's likelihood of staying in a job.
